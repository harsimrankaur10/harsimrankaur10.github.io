		<h3> More about India and Tourist attractions</h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p class="first-paragraph"> Delhi's top tourist attractions include spellbinding forts, mosques, and monuments built by the Mughal rulers who once ruled the city. A lot of them are set in beautiful landscaped gardens that can help you relax.</p>
				<p class="second-paragraph"> A part of India's popular Golden Triangle tourist circuit, Agra is home to the Taj Mahal. It's most iconic monument of India and the top historical tourist attraction.  For the same reason, it's not justified to leave it off the list. </p>
				<p class="third-paragraph">Varanasi, one of the top spiritual places in India, is a city quite like no other. This mystical holy city openly reveals its rituals along the many riverside ghats, which are used for everything from bathing to burning the bodies of the dead.</p>
				<p class="fourth-paragraph">No doubt India's most popular and widely recognized caves, the Ajanta Ellora caves are carved into hillside rock quite in the middle of nowhere, near Aurangabad, in northern Maharashtra. These caves are simply awe inspiring. </p>
				<p class="fifth-paragraph">An incredible energy can be found in Hampi, one of the top places to visit in Karnataka. The last capital of Vijayanagar, one of the greatest Hindu kingdoms in Indiaâ€™s history, it's renowned for its captivating ruins, intriguingly intermingled with large boulders that rear up all over the landscape. Hampi's laid-back vibe  attracts plenty of travelers who like to stay a while and chill out there.</p>
